| BOT in Slack    |     On-going   | Need to cover more action for the BOT.
|Task Tracking |    Wait  | Once we connect two platform, we can start creating some mocking data to test.
|Screencast    |    N/A   | Will do screencast when all section has been done.

##### Week 2

| Deliverable   | assigned  |  Issues/Tasks
| ------------- | ------------  |  ------------
| Mocking Service Component     | person 2   | mock.json file for trello data,how to create mock output data-- similar json file ?,what is injection?
| Bot Platform| Done  | python implementation to deploy bot in Slack
| Trello API connect | Done | sample trello api calls made via python library TrelloClient
| database storage | on hold | need to determine if we need that
| Posting data | Doing Research | How to efficiently post detail data on trello and slack by the bot (e.g. leaderboard)
| Bot Interaction | person 1,3 | make commands for 3 use cases -- what shall be a full conversation?, make timer for bot, make the bot provide push notifications on specific time 
| Selenium testing   |perosn 4 | After previous tasks are done   
|Task Tracking |    On progress | subtasks divided and assigned for last week
|Screencast    |    N/A   | Will do screencast when all section has been done.

##### Week 2.5

| Deliverable   | assigned  |  Issues/Tasks
| ------------- | ------------  |  ------------
| Mocking Service Component     | almost done   | created mock.json file to read data in the program wherever real data is not possible to achieve. NOT SURE WHAT IS INJECTION?
| database storage | on hold | need to determine if we need that
| Posting data | some progress | can post raw data. need to determine to post data in good, fashionable format.
| Bot Interaction | good progress | can send messages and recieve & understand(based on hardcoded formats) messages at any channel. It can also send emails. FORMATS FOR UNDERSTANDING COMMANDS NEED POLISHING
| Capturing response | doing research | capturing email replies and answers to questions asked to users in direct messages. Users can reply at any time. The bot needs to wait and poll for the responses for all of them at a time (concurrency?) and also need to code how it can interprete the reponses
| Selenium testing   |doing research | last work  
|Task Tracking |    On progress | subtasks divided and assigned for last week
|Screencast    |    N/A   | last work
|use case 1 | done for bot milestone | 1 person has wrote codes for use case 1 as much as it needed to be implemented in milestone:bot. 
|use case 2 | done for bot milestone  | 1 person has wrote codes for use case 1 as much as it needed to be implemented in milestone:bot. 
|use case 3 | done for bot milestone  | 1 person has wrote codes for use case 1 as much as it needed to be implemented in milestone:bot.
