### Problem Solved by Task Manager

In software engineering field, a project is always divided into multiple parts for each developer.
Sometimes your work might depend on others work (concurrent issue), with our task manager BOT, it
is unnecessary to keep asking the progress of your colleagues. Our BOT will notify every member in
the same channel that who completed what work. This can reduce the overhead of tracking others' progress
such as personal message or emails.
On the other hand, from the lecture, we know that the average working hours are 2 hours per day for each engineer if lucky (No other disturbing things
    such as meeting, business trip and so on). To improve the productivity of a developer, our BOT will calculate reward points for developers that
    finish the assigned tasks. It will display the leaderboard and next target board for you to achieve. The BOT will post congratulation message as well as reminder message
    in public channel to alert everyone that whose contribution is not enough and need to work hard.
    This can be viewed as peer pressure that urge you to code more and make more contribution.
Besides, we all need some tools to help us tracking many tasks. Our BOT also has a function that will send the user a reminder email for pending task and it just like an annoying alarm clock did not go off if you don't complete your task.
