## Milestone - SERVICE ##
Our bot runs on the assumption that a team will have their workspace both on "Slack" and "Trello". They use trello to keep track of their tasks, and "Slack" for communication. With necessary permissions, our bot resides in Slack and also can fetch/post data on Trello workspace of the team. 


### Task Tracking
[Trello Task Manager](https://trello.com/b/MXYu6ZEy/task-manager-bot)  Used for task tracking like worksheet. 

[Testing Board](https://trello.com/b/3L2DxAis/test-board) Trello board for us to test the function.
